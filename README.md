Hi, Iâ€™m Talitho or LeTalitho, as my username says.

I'm a french developer, still learning, I'm currently focussing on python but I plan to learn C++ and html.
I'm not really looking forward to collaborate since I'm still learning, but I appreciate any kind of help.
To reach me I'm mostly avaible on discord (@Talitho#2705), so if you want to contact me about anything, it's just the place!
That sums up my current situation, I'll keep this file updated, if I think about it
